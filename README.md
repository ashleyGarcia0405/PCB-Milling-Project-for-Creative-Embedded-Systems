Files and steps for completion of the PCB Milling Assignment

# Step 1: KiCAD PCB Layout

To complete this step, you must arrange and route connections between the components of the 555 timer LED flasher circuit inside KiCAD's PCB editor. There are two tutorial videos for this section. The first move through the whole process in detail and also gives context for the layout process in reference to the milling and assembly portion of this assignment. The second video is much shorter and runs through the process with little explanation. It is meant to be watched after the first video and to be a reference as you're doing the assignment.
